#
# This is a primitive line editor
# designed for coding IBM S370 BAL source.
#
# You can also call the S370BALAsm or
# the S370BALEmulator so it's almost
# an IDE (edit - assemble - emulate
# all in one place)
#
# Programmers actually used a line editor
# similar to this one over 40 years ago.
#
# Using the TAB key you can format
# your assembler source for the
# expected column layout of:
# 1     10       16
# label mnemonic operands  [optional comment]
#
# For example, you can type:
# balr[TAB KEY]r12,0
#
# to add this line:
#          BALR  R12,0
#
# Another example, you can type:
# loop[TAB KEY]mvi[TAB KEY]0(r5),c'0'
#
# to add this line:
# LOOP     MVI   0(R5),C'0'
#
# A line that starts with an '*' is
# assumed to be a comment
#
# A line with no TAB charaters
# is assumed to be an editor command.
#
# For example, if you typed:
#
# list
#
# an enumerated source listing would be 
# displayed.
